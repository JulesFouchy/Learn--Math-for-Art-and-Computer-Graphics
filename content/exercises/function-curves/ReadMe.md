https://julesfouchy.github.io/Guess-the-Curve/ (Extension (TODO) : have only a limited amount of building blocks, like cards (sin, x, exp) that you can compose with each other (with addition, multiplication, composition) Each card has the graph of the curve as a thumbnail, you can move them around and layer them on top of each other to compare the functions side-by-side on the same plot :

Other tool (TODO) : Draw-the-Curve : you can draw by hand the curve that you expect, and then have the result pop up and compare them.
