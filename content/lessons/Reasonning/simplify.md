You don't learn to do hard things, you learn to simplify them:
- split problems in smaller pieces
- start with an example / a simple case
- build intuition for the problem; develop / get familiar with the theoretical concepts so that they can fit more easily in your brain all at once and you can get a view of the whole problem at once.
