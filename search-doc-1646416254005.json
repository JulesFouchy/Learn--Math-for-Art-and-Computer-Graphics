Our graph will look like the graph of sin⁡\\sinsin, but it will be bounded by the graphs of −1x-\\frac{1}{x}−x1​ and 1x\\frac{1}{x}x1​.  Then, around 0 : sin(x)sin(x)sin(x) and xxx are very similar (we say that they are equivalent and we write it sin⁡(x)∼x\\sin(x) \\sim xsin(x)∼x)  And since dividing a number by itself gives 111, sin⁡(x)x≈1\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\approx 1xsin(x)​≈1 as we get close to 0. One objection might be that we are dividing by xxx which is almost 000, so the result should tend to infinity ; but actually since sin⁡(x)\\sin(x)sin(x) is also very close to 0, they compensate each other and the result tends to 1 because sin⁡(x)≈x\\sin(x) \\approx xsin(x)≈x.
